# How to create a website using GitHub Pages
## Purpose
This readme will explain how to host a markdown resume as a website using GitHub pages.  
Additionally, it will connect the setup steps to their corresponding principle outlined in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing. 

## Prerequisites
* A markdown formatted resume.  
If you do not know how to create a resume formatted using Markdown then you can find a tutorial in the [More Resources](#more-resources) section below.

* A GitHub account.  
You can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup?source=login). 

## Instructions

![This is a visual version of the manual steps written out below.](https://github.com/chayward3113/chayward3113.github.io/blob/main/walkthrough.gif)

1. Confirm that the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above have been completed.  
   When we create our resume, we should follow the model that Andrew Etter set out in his book Modern Technical Writing.
   1. The first step is don't write this encourages us to learn everything we can about our topic, goal and how to achieve our goal.
   2. Then we should define our audience this encourages us to meet with and learn about our audience so that we don't do unnecessary work and so that we achieve our goal.
   3. Next we write the basic functional documentation in this step we write about the things that we learned in don't write and we write to the audience we defined. According to Etter in this step at a minimum we need to answer the following questions: what the product is, why we want it, how it fits into the bigger picture, where we can get it, how we can get it and how we can use it.
   4. Finally, we should review our writing to make sure it follows Etter's style principle. We should make sure we are consistent in spelling and formatting. Additionally, we should restructure paragraphs into tables, lists, diagrams, and images wherever possible to make our text more legible. Lastly, we should not use jargon that might confuse our audience. 

2. ### Create GitHub repository
    1. Sign-in to [GitHub](https://github.com/login).  
    2. Click the plus icon in the top right corner of the screen.
    3. Click New repository. 
    4. Name your repository username.github.io where username is your username.
    5. Check the Add a README option.
    6. Click the Create repository button at the bottom of the screen.  
In this step we follow Etter's principle of helping others write by making a public GitHub repository. Which allows anyone with a GitHub account to add, edit or delete files within our repository. This way our users can help us maintain useful and up to date documentation.

3. ### Build Website
    1. Click Add file > Upload files.
    2. Select your markdown formatted resume for upload. 
    3. Click Commit changes.
    4. Click your resume name.
    5. Click the pencil icon to edit.
    6. Change your resumeâ€™s file name to be index.md.
    7. Commit changes. Now if you navigate to username.github.io in your web-browser you should see your markdown formatted resume.  
In this step we demonstrate Etter's principle of building a website. We want to create a website to ensure that everyone always has access to the most up to date version of our documentation. Additionally, it makes updating and distributing documentation both faster and simpler. 

4. ### Setup Markdown styling
    1. Click the Code tab in your GitHub repository.
    2. Click Add file > Create new file.
    3. Name the file _config.yml.
    4. Find a Jekyll theme that you like. I have added links in the [More Resources](#more-resources) section below to a variety of Jekyll themes.
    5. Follow your Jekyll themes installation guide.
    6. Click commit changes.  
In this step we again use Etter's step of building a website. This time we add a theme to make our Markdown file prettier and easier for our users to read. 

5. ### Rebuild website with style choice
    1. Click code.  
Now you should see a yellow dot above the list of files. This indicates that your website is being rebuilt. It will be done building when the dot turns into a green check mark this should take a couple minutes. For more details on the build including what it is doing, and its progress simply click on the yellow dot followed by details.
    2. Navigate to username.github.io where username is your username. You should now see your resume formatted using the style that you chose.  
In this step we use Etter's principle of updating frequently. Because whenever, we save a change to our repository the site rebuilds within a matter of minutes. This allows us to easily make changes to our site that happen almost instantly, making publishing frequently simple. Lastly, since we can publish frequently maintaining a catalog of difference doesn't take much effort. With every release the developers can simply inform us of the changes and we can describe them in a README for all our users to see.

## FAQs
**Why is Markdown better than a word processor?**  
Markdown is better than a word processor for several reasons: 
* The first is that Markdown editors are free so anybody can use them. Thus, it makes it easier for others to contribute to markdown files.
* Secondly, it has fewer formatting options which makes it simpler to use. Therefore, you can write content faster without needing to worry about styling.
* Lastly, we can ensure a consistent style across multiple files by using a single Jekyll style. Thus, removing the need to manually select the same template each time in word.

 
**Why is my resume not showing up?**  
If your resume is not showing up, then you should try the following:
1. Confirm that the build has completed by verifying that the yellow circle is gone, and the green checkmark is present.
2. Confirm that the name of your resume is index.md.
3. Confirm that your repository has the name username.github.io where username is your GitHub username.
4. Confirm that you are using the correct URL which is https://username.github.io.
